#### model control


**`n.species`** : `Integer`

number of species in community. If not provided, then the length of `x0` is used.


**`x0`** : `numeric`

initial abundances of species. If not provided, then a draw from uniform distribution from 0.1 to 10 is used as the initial abundances of species.

must have same length as `n.species`


**`names.species`** : `character vector`

names of species to use during the simulation. If not provided, species are named as *sp1, sp2, ...*

must have same length as `n.species`


**`migration.p`** : `numeric`

probability/frequency of migration of certain individuals from a metacommunity in each time step of the simulation. The strength of migration is controlled by `sigma.migration` . By default is 0.01


**`metacommunity.probability`** : `numeric vector`

the probability distribution of likelihood that species from the metacommunity can enter the community during the simulation. If not given, `n.species` of numbers will be drawn from a dirichlet distribution which alpha = 1.

must have same length as `n.species`.


**`k.events`** : `numeric`

the number of individual replacements (growth + migration) happening during a small time interval \tau. By default is 1. 

must have same length as `n.species`.


**`growth.rates`** : `numeric`

growth rates of species. In this Hubbell model, this variable defines the change rate of abundance of each species. If not provided, then 1 will be used for each species, meaning in each small time interval \tau,  number of newly born individuals + number of immigrants = number of dead individuals.

must have same length as `n.species`.


**`error.variance`** : `numeric`

the variance of measurement error. By default is 0, indicating that the result won't contain any measurement error.

This value must be non-negative.

**`norm`** : `boolean`

whether the returned result should be normalized (return relative abundances for species in the community). By default is `FALSE` .



#### time control

**`t.end`** : `numeric`

the final time of the simulation. If not given, by default is 1000.

**`t.start`** : `numeric`

the starting time of the simulation. If not given, by default is 0. Must be less than `t.end`

**`t.step`** : `numeric`

the time interval for each step of calculation. If not given, by default is 0.1

**`t.store`** : `numeric`

the number of time points to store/export for the whole simulation. If not given, by default is 1000. Note that must be less than `(t.end - t.start)/t.step` .
