#### basics

**`n.species`** : `Integer`

number of species in community

**`names.species`** : `character vector`

names of species to use during the simulation. If not provided, species are named as *sp1, sp2, ...*

must have same length as `n.species`

#### time control

**`t.end`** : `numeric`

the final time of the simulation. If not given, by default is 1000.

**`t.start`** : `numeric`

the starting time of the simulation. If not given, by default is 0. Must be less than `t.end`

**`t.step`** : `numeric`

the time interval for each step of calculation. If not given, by default is 0.1

**`t.store`** : `numeric`

the number of time points to store/export for the whole simulation. If not given, by default is 1000. Note that must be less than `(t.end - t.start)/t.step` .

#### growth and death rates

**`x0`** : `numeric`

initial abundances of species. If not provided, then a draw from uniform distribution from 0.1 to 10 is used as the initial abundances of species.

must have same length as `n.species`

**`growth.rates`** : `numeric`

growth rates of species. In this logistic model, this variable is the $r$ in aforementioned equation. If not provided, then random draws in a uniform distribution from 0.1 to 0.2 will be used for all species.

must have same length as `n.species`

**`death.rates`** : `numeric`

death rates of species. In this logistic model, this variable is the $death.rates$ in aforementioned equation. If not provided, then random draws in a uniform distribution from 0.0005 to 0.0025 will be used for all species.

must have same length as `n.species`

**`carrying.capacities`** : `numeric`

carrying capacities of species. In this logistic model, this variable is the $K$ in aforementioned equation. If not provided, then random draws in a uniform distribution from 1000 to 2000 will be used for all species.

must have same length as `n.species`

#### stochasticity

**`stochastic`**: `boolean`

whether to include stochasticity in the simulation. By default `stochastic` is `FALSE` .

**`sigma.drift`**: `numeric`

strengths of ecological drift which happens on each step in the simulation. By default is 0.001, indicating the standard deviation of a normally distributed noise.

Controlled by `stochastic` .

**`sigma.epoch`** : `numeric`

strength of intrinsic fluctuations of community. By default is 0.1. This stochastic epoch event is not continuous and the probability/frequency is controlled by `epoch.p` .

Controlled by `stochastic` .

**`epoch.p`** : `numeric`

probability/frequency of intrinsic random periodic changes introduced to the community composition. By default is 0.001.

Controlled by `stochastic` .

**`sigma.external`** : `numeric`

strength of external disturbances happening on the given time points. Time points are defined using `t.external_events` and `t.external_durations` . By default is 0.3

Controlled by `stochastic` .

**`t.external_events`** : `numeric vector`

starting time points of external disturbances. By default there's no external events.

Controlled by `stochastic` .

must have same length as `t.external_durations`

**`t.external_durations`** : `numeric vector`

durations of external disturbances. By default there's no external events.

Controlled by `stochastic` .

must have same length as `t.external_events`

**`migration.p`** : `numeric`

probability/frequency of migration of certain individuals from a metacommunity in each time step of the simulation. The strength of migration is controlled by `sigma.migration` . By default is 0.01

Controlled by `stochastic` .

**`sigma.migration`** : `numeric`

intensity of migration at each time step. By default is 0.01

**`metacommunity.probability`** : `numeric vector`

the probability distribution of likelihood that species from the metacommunity can enter the community during the simulation. If not given, `n.species` of numbers will be drawn from a dirichlet distribution which alpha = 1.

must have same length as `n.species` .

**`error.variance`** : `numeric`

the variance of measurement error. By default is 0, indicating that the result won't contain any measurement error.

This value must be non-negative.

**`norm`** : `boolean`

whether the returned result should be normalized (return relative abundances for species in the community). By default is `FALSE` .
